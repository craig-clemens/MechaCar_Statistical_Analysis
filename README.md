## Linear Regression to Predict MPG
[PICTURE]
Given that the variance of a non-random variable is usually 0, the fact that the intercept, ground clearance, and vehicle length coefficients provide an amount of varience to the MPG values that are non-random.

We are able to regect the null hypothesis because of the incredibly small p-value of 5.35e-11, well below the significance level of 0.05. By rejecting the null hypothesis we can conclude that the slope is not 0.

The adjusted r-squared of 0.6825 shows that this linear model predicts the MPG fairly well. As the Multiple r-squared value increases as more variables are passed into the regression, the adjusted r-squared value controls for this increase, making it a better predictor for how effective a this linear model is.
