## Linear Regression to Predict MPG
[PICTURE]
Given that the variance of a non-random variable is usually 0, the fact that the intercept, ground clearance, and vehicle length coefficients provide an amount of varience to the MPG values that are non-random.

We are able to regect the null hypothesis because of the incredibly small p-value of 5.35e-11, well below the significance level of 0.05. By rejecting the null hypothesis we can conclude that the slope is not 0.

The adjusted r-squared of 0.6825 shows that this linear model predicts the MPG fairly well. As the Multiple r-squared value increases as more variables are passed into the regression, the adjusted r-squared value controls for this increase, making it a better predictor for how effective a this linear model is. 

## Summary Statistics on Suspension Coils

[TOTAL SUMMARY]
[LOT SUMMARY]

Most notably when we separate the dataset into 3 different lots, the third lot has a much larger variance, even when the overall variance for the entire dataset indicates that all manufacturing data meets the 100 pounds per square inch variance limitation.

Since the lots were chosen randomly, it is possible that a large subsection of the sample does not meet the necessary requirements for suspension coils.
